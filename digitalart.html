      <div style="flex: 1;"> <h3 id="header">"I Always Forget and Remember on the Train."</h3> <p>A <a href="https://poets.org/text/brief-guide-flarf-poetry">flarf</a> poem in which the title is the exact words of a text I'd recently sent at the time of making this. I used the text as flarf material - I Googled the text verbatum, then collaged together any text on the search page that called to me. The result is an exploration of memory and habit. I personally had sent the text because every day I realize I forget something once boarding the train -- at which point it is too late. Sometimes it's my breakfast on the counter, my scarf, notebook... it's always something. </p></div>

      <div style="flex: 1;"> <h3 id="header">Sim's Zoom</h3> <p>For this project, I created a looping Zoom background using the Sims 4. I built a realistic office, and wanted to have weird activities in the background. Behind where one sits in a Zoom call is a recording of myself that I've placed over the Sims laptop screen, to create a video within a video. ALso, outside the window I created a sim to match me (and my cats!) who walks around the fountain in the further background. </p> </div>

      <div> <h3 id="header">Sleepy</h3> <p>My first Twine game! <i>Sleepy</i> mirrors the flow of a mind-specifically one at night. Players make choices that impact the experience of going to sleep. Different choices lead to different endings; some very similar, some quite different. I especially wanted to explore sleep hygiene, as I personally struggle with making the right choices before bed to feel well rested; such as being on screens too late, or forgetting to stretch. Sometimes our thoughts keep us up, and sometimes media that we consume before sleep even impact our dreams! If you play all the paths, you'll find different genres within this one game. I learned that Twine can feel like a journal, in the sense that the writing & pathways created reflect the user making the game - for instance, I have an upcoming dental surgery and include thoughts of dental visits in the game.</p> </div>
