    <div id="textright"><h3>Hi, I'm Hope!</h3>
      <p style="font-size: 15px;">I'm an artist and student, among many other things. I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Interdisciplinary Education in the Arts (with a minor in Psychology), and looking forward to applying to Master's Degree programs in Social Work soon! The <i>eventual</i> goal is to be licensed in both social work <i>and</i> art therapy. I want to use the education I am gaining to help other who need support, because community is vital. I also believe that partaking in recreational activites (esepcially art!) can have many benefits -- and we live in a world that could use all the therapeutic practices!

        <br>
        As for my experience, I've got an extensive history in customer service from working in countless food industry jobs, as well as with children nannying and in a preschool environment. I also completed a yoga teacher training and spent time living on a community farm. I've taken both a mental health first aid and a death doula training to expand the ways that I can help others. I've also had the opportunity to be in art fairs and a gallery! These experiences have all brought me where I am and taught me so much!
        <br>
        <br>
        In my free time, I love yoga, hiking, camping (most outdoor activities!), painting (acrylics, oils, and watercolors), crocheting, weaving, writing poetry, making collages, cooking and baking (all vegetarian or vegan), gaming, and more! I love learning how to do new things, and teaching others.

        This site is here to share some of my digital artworks, as well as provide context as to who I am. I hope you enjoy your time here and have a great day!
